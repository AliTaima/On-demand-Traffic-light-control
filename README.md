# On-demand Traffic light control
---
This is the 2nd project in the Embedded Systems - FWD T2 Professional track
# Project requirements
- implement a traffic lights system with an on-demand crosswalk button.
- Crosswalk buttons let the signal operations know that someone is planning to cross the street, so the light adjusts, giving the pedestrian enough time to get across.
- System Design
- Prepare development environment
- Implement the application
- Testing the application
## Hardware requirements
- ATmega32 microcontroller
- One push button connected to INT0 pin for pedestrian
- Three LEDs for cars - Green, Yellow, and Red, connected on port A, pins 0, 1, and 2
- Three LEDs for pedestrians - Green, Yellow, and Red, connected on port B, pins 0, 1, and 2
